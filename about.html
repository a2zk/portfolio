    <div class="about">
        <div class="left">
            <p>I am a student studying Graphic Design at Western Washington University. Through art people can share
                mutual
                understanding of ideas. Design’s intrigue for me is its ability to convey meaning and emotion. Language
                is
                not a barrier when communicating visually. Powerful design can spark a movement or lay the foundation
                for a
                business’s or event’s reputation. I am interested in both computing and art. I feel design brings
                elements
                from each field, the versatility of computing and the expressiveness of art. I hope to find a career in
                design that allows me to combine my passions in
                computing and art. Good design inspires people, is beautiful, and is useful in any industry. I will make
                a difference through good design.</p>
